# BinaryInk's Firefox CSS

This is currently in a very rough state. v1.0.0 will indicate when it is in a
more acceptable state.

This does not take into account things such as touch v. compact mode and is
entirely meant for laptop/desktop use.

## Features

### VSCode Theme

<!-- TODO Add link to Hyprland repo -->
Follows VSCode syntax colors, similar to most of my customization projects. It
is designed to match my Hyprland theme in particular.

When completed, it will also follow light/dark theme changes as well.

### Sidebery

<!-- TODO Add link to Sidebery repo and/or extension page -->
Provides enhancements for the extension Sidebery:

### UI

- Navigation bar is always on bottom
- Navigation & Tab bars are slimmer, buttons smaller
- Transparency on all possible UI elements
  - Unfortunately, sidebar plugins--such as Sidebery--are rendered with an opaque, grey background by Firefox, so plugins in particular cannot be transparent.

## Known Issues & Roadmap
