# BinaryInk's Firefox CSS

This is currently in a very rough state. v1.0.0 will indicate when it is in an
acceptable state.

## Features

### VSCode Theme

<!-- TODO Add link to Hyprland repo -->
Follows VSCode syntax colors, similar to most of my customization projects. It
is designed to match my Hyprland theme in particular.

When completed, it will also follow light/dark theme changes as well.

### Sidebery

<!-- TODO Add link to Sidebery repo and/or extension page -->
Provides enhancements for the extension Sidebery

### Compact

Minimizes and shrinks various elements of the UI, as I find the default Firefox
UI to be fairly large and cumbersome for non-touchscreen use.
